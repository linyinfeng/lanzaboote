///
/// On a high-level, the signer only needs to know how to:
///
/// - build and sign a stub at the same time
/// - sign specific Nix store paths, e.g. systemd bootloader
/// - sign and copy from a certain location to another: this is automatically derived
///   from other trait implementations, but the implementation may be simpler
///   for specific signers.
/// - get a *stable* opaque public key identifier used for content addressing
///   on the ESP partition
/// - verify a PE binary for its signature
/// - verify a specific path to a PE binary for its signature: automatically derived from the
///   previous but can be provided for simpler implementation.
///
/// To implement a new signer, provide a minimal implementation of this trait
/// and pass this implementation to any front-facing tool of Lanzaboote, e.g. `lzbt-systemd`
/// as all tools does not have to support a new signature scheme.
